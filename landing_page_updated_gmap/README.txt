Full Landing Page — ZIP
=======================

Files included:
- index.html         -> Main landing page
- assets/css/styles.css
- assets/js/main.js

Placeholders to replace before publishing:
- INSTAGRAM_PROFILE  -> your Instagram handle (e.g. yourhandle)
- WHATSAPP_NUMBER    -> phone in international format without + (e.g. 919876543210)
- GOOGLE_MAPS_URL    -> full Google Maps place or review URL
- info@yourcompany.com -> update with your real email address

Notes:
- The contact form attempts to POST to /send. If you don't have a backend, the script falls back to opening the user's email client with a prefilled message.
- You can host this as a static site. For form handling, add an endpoint or use Formspree/Netlify Forms.
